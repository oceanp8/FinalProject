C

What happens to the motion of an object when balanced forces act on it?
It speeds up
It slows down
It changes direction
It stays the same
D

What is the speed of light in a vacuum?
300 m/s
1,500 m/s
300,000 km/s
9.8 m/s^2
C

A car moves in a circle at constant speed. What can be said about the net force acting on it?
There is no net force
The net force is outward
The net force is inward
The net force is zero since speed is constant
C

A 10 N force is applied to a 2 kg object at rest. What is its velocity after 3 seconds?
10 m/s
15 m/s
20 m/s
30 m/s
B

A ball is thrown straight up. At its highest point:
Velocity is zero, acceleration is zero
Velocity is zero, acceleration is g
Velocity is g, acceleration is zero
Both are zero
B

Two objects of different masses are dropped from the same height. Ignoring air resistance, they hit the ground:
At different times
At the same time
With different accelerations
With zero speed
B

A box is pushed with a constant force across a rough surface and moves at a constant speed. What can you conclude about the net force acting on the box?
Friction is greater than the applied force
The applied force is greater than friction
The net force is zero
The box is accelerating
